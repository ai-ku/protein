	First referee's report

The authors report on the anharmonicity and mode-coupling
contributions to protein conformational entropy. The Hermite expansion
is applied to the fluctuation probability distribution function (PDF)
of crambin molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory. The PDFs including the
anharmonicity and the mode-coupling between a pair of modes are
separately calculated as well as the harmonic PDF. It is concluded
that the anharmonicity and the mode-coupling derive a minor
improvement of the entropy estimation from the harmonic approximation.
I like the PDF to be analyzed as the tensorial Hermite polynomials,
allowing the anharmonicity and the mode-coupling to be evaluated.
However, in this study the associated application is restricted to the
entropy calculation for the overall degrees of freedom and then there
remains much room for further improvement, I think. Firstly, the
anharmonicity and mode-coupling contributions should be carefully
observed via the free energy surfaces for various kinds of modes, such
as =93anharmonic=94,=93quasiharmonic=94, and =93harmonic=94 modes (see Ref.=
 3),
without being limited to only mode 1 and 2. Then the entropy should be
calculated separately. For =93anharmonic=94 and =93quasiharmonic=94 modes t=
he
resulting entropy may be dominated by the anharmonicity and the
mode-coupling. Secondly, I doubt whether the MD simulation time (here,
900 ps) will be enough for estimating the higher-order polynomials.
Much longer simulation should be performed to examine whether the
derived polynomials are well converged. Thirdly, it is not clear how
the Hermite polynomials are calculated by eq. 5. The harmonic
approximation is applied for the PDF in eq. 5? And how many terms
(i.e., rank) are summed up for deriving f1 and f2?


	Second referee's report

The manuscript reports on a method to analyze residue fluctuations in
proteins and apply their approach to calculate a multidimensional
energy landscape of crambin around its native state. Harmonic elastic
network models have very successfully described residue fluctuations
in proteins, and this work moves beyond the harmonic limit,
introducing anharmonic coupling between the harmonic modes. The effect
on the fluctuational entropy due to anharmonic interactions is
examined and found to be small, but the shape of the free energy
landscape that is calculated is strongly modified by anharmonicity.
The paper will interest readers of Physical Biology and publication is
recommended.

There are other approaches used to compute free energy landscapes that
naturally incorporate anharmonicity, specifically free energy
landscapes determined in terms of lowest principal components or
dihedral principal components, along which the protein makes
relatively large displacements. This has been done, for example, by
Stock and coworkers (J. Chem. Phys. 128, 245102, (2008)) and
Maisuradze and Leitner (Proteins: Structure, Function and
Bioinformatics 67, (2007)) and Maisuradze et al (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102
238102 (2009)). It would be useful if the authors would compare and
discuss the merits of their approach to determine free energy
landscape of a protein near its native structure against other
approaches such as these.


	Third referee's report

Currently popular elastic network model (ENM) essentially approximate
the free energy of a given structure as a single harmonic well.
However, a real protein in its native basin at room temperature hops
and samples between multiply degenerate potential wells instead of
residing a single deep well.
In this paper, the author made a series expansion of the probability
distribution function (pdf) of atomic fluctuation from its equilibrium
position by cleverly adapting the method introduced in the classic
paper by Flory and Yoon for polymer chain, i.e., the three dimensional
hermite expansion of density distribution.
The authors showed that an inclusion of series expansion terms up to
the mode-coupling termsenables them to capture the multi-centered
feature of free energy landscape, the result of which compares well
with the one using non-parametric kernel density estimation to the
density map (or pdf) generated from MD simulation of a test protein
(Crambin).
Although the amount of entropy correction due to anharmonic
mode-coupling is small, the inclusion of 2nd order mode-coupling terms
in particular, in addition to the 1st order hermite polynomial terms,
is important to calculate the free energy surface more faithfully.

I believe that beyond ENM this is an important improvement toward
understanding to the fluctuations of molecule at its native state,
thus strongly support the publication of this paper to the Physical
Biology.
