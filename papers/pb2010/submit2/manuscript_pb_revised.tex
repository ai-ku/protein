\begin{abstract}
We develop a general framework for the analysis of residue
fluctuations that simultaneously incorporates anharmonicity and
mode-coupling in a unified formalism. We show that both deviations
from the Gaussian model are important for modeling the
multidimensional energy landscape of the protein Crambin (1EJG) in the
vicinity of its native state.  The effect of anharmonicity and
mode-coupling on the fluctuational entropy is on the order of a few
percent.

\section{Introduction}

Residue fluctuations of a protein around its native state reveal
information that bridges the molecule's structural and functional
properties.  At the lowest order, these fluctuations can be treated as
a collection of independent harmonic modes, yielding ``Elastic Network
Models''~\cite{bahar1997direct,atilgan2001anisotropy}. On the other
hand, it is known that the slowest oscillatory modes of a protein are
strongly
anharmonic~\cite{hayward1994harmonic,pontiggia2007anharmonicity,yogurtcu2009statistical},
in contrast with the assumption underlying ENMs. The coupling between
different modes is another aspect of protein dynamics that is believed
to be relevant for the information/energy transfer between different
parts of the molecule~\cite{moritsugu2000vibrational,leitner2008energy} and not
captured by the harmonicity assumption. Our aim here is to gauge respectively
the relative contributions of these two distinct anharmonic corrections to the free
energy by means of a formalism that distinguishes them naturally.

\section{Modal expansion and beyond}
Sampling the time evolution of a protein by using molecular dynamics
reveals a multivariate probability distribution function (pdf) $f({\bf\Delta
R})$ for the deviations of atoms (assume there are $N$ of them) from
their mean positions, i.e. $\Delta R_i = R_i - R_i^{0}$,
$i=1,\dots,3N$. We here adopt a coarse-grained representation of this
pdf where only $C^\alpha$ atoms are considered, so that $N$ is also the
number of residues. Accordingly, $R_i^{0}$ are the mean $C^\alpha$
coordinates corresponding to the average configuration of the protein during
the part of the trajectory that is used for the calculations.

\subsection{Hermite expansion}
Since the deviations from this free energy minimum are expected to be
harmonic for sufficiently small amplitudes, Hermite polynomials -
which are orthogonal {\it wrt} a Gaussian weight function - constitute
a natural basis for representing $f({\bf\Delta R})$. First, following
Ref.~\cite{garcia1992large,yogurtcu2009statistical}, we perform the
transformation
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:rotation}
{\bf \Delta r} &=& \langle {\bf\Delta R \Delta R}^T\rangle ^{-1/2} {\bf
  \Delta R}\ .
\end{eqnarray}
This diagonalizes the covariance matrix $ \Gamma\equiv\langle
{\bf\Delta R \Delta R}^T\rangle$ ($\langle \cdot\rangle$
represents averaging over the trajectory) and would give the normal
modes of the protein if fluctuations were harmonic. Otherwise, the
distribution function for $\{\Delta r_i\}$ in its most general form, can
be expressed as~\cite{flory1974moments}
\begin{small}
\begin{equation}
\label{hermite_expansion}
f({\bf\Delta r}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{3N}}} e^{
    -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{3N} \Delta r_i^2} \bigg[ 1 +  \sum_{\nu=3}^\infty
 {\bf C_\nu}\cdot {\bf H}_\nu({\bf \Delta r}) \bigg]
\end{equation}
\end{small}

\noindent where ${\bf C}_\nu$ (constant) and ${\bf H}_\nu$ (derived
below) are tensors of rank $\nu$, and the dot product refers to
$\sum_{ij..k}\,C_\nu^{ij..k}\,H_\nu^{ij..k}$.  The fluctuations
$\{\Delta r_i\}$ in this mode space spanned by the eigenvectors of
$\Gamma$ are meanless, i.e., $\langle {\Delta r_i}\rangle = 0$, and
decoupled at the lowest (second) order, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
\langle {
\label{eqn:pair_corr}
  \Delta r_i^T \Delta r_j}\rangle = \delta_{ij}\ .
\end{equation}
The modes are numbered in the order of the corresponding nonzero
eigenvalues of $\Gamma$, i.e., smaller ranking modes are also the
slowest ones. A purely harmonic model is given by ${\bf C}_\nu =
0,\ \forall \nu$. Note that, the atomic fluctuations corresponding to
a given mode can easily be calculated by setting to zero all the
eigenvalues except the one of interest, followed by a back
transformation of Eq.~(\ref{eq:rotation}).

Tensor Hermite polynomials can be
obtained by successive differentiation using Rodrigues' formula:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{Rodrigues}
H_{\nu}^{ij..k}({\bf \Delta r}) &=& \frac{(-1)^\nu}{g({\bf
    \Delta r})}\,{\bf\nabla}^{ij..k}\,g({\bf \Delta r})\ .
\end{eqnarray}
Above, $g({\bf x}) = (2\pi)^{3N/2}\exp(-{\bf x}^2/2)$ is the
multidimen{\-}sional Gaussian distribution and ${\bf \nabla}^{ij..k} =
\nabla^i\nabla^j\,..\,\nabla^k$ is the gradient tensor with
$\nabla^i \equiv \partial/\partial x_i$.
The tensor coefficients that appear in $f({\bf \Delta r})$
follow from the orthogonality relation as
\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{coefs}
{\bf C}_\nu &=& \frac{1}{\nu!}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {\bf H}_\nu({\bf x})
f({\bf\Delta r})\, {\bf d\Delta r} =  \langle {\bf H}_\nu({\bf\Delta r})\rangle/\nu!
\label{eqn:orthogonality}
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, the problem reduces to obtaining the expectation values of
the polynomial tensor elements for the system. At the lowest
nonvanishing order they read
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{H3}
{\bf H}_3^{111}({\bf x}) &=& x_1^3 -3x_1 \nonumber \\
{\bf H}_3^{112}({\bf x}) &=& x_1^2x_2 -x_2 = {\bf H}_3^{121}({\bf x}) = {\bf
  H}_3^{211}({\bf x}) \nonumber \\
{\bf H}_3^{123}({\bf x}) &=& x_1x_2x_3 = {\bf H}_3^{213}({\bf x}) = \cdots
\end{eqnarray}
Higher order tensor elements can be calculated using a diagrammatic technique.
%% \begin{eqnarray}
%% \label{H4}
%% {\bf H}_4^{1111}({\bf x}) &=& x_1^4 -6x_1^2 + 3 \nonumber \\
%% {\bf H}_4^{1112}({\bf x}) &=& x_1^3x_2 - 3x_1x_2 \nonumber \\
%% &=& {\bf H}_3^{1121}({\bf x}) = {\bf H}_3^{1211}({\bf x}) = {\bf  H}_3^{2111}({\bf x}) \nonumber \\
%% {\bf H}_4^{1122}({\bf x}) &=& x_1^2x_2^2 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 + 1 \nonumber \\
%% &=& {\bf H}_4^{1212}({\bf x}) = {\bf  H}_4^{1221}({\bf x}) \nonumber \\
%% {\bf H}_4^{1123}({\bf x}) &=& x_1^2x_2x_3 - x_2x_3  \nonumber \\
%% &=& {\bf H}_4^{1231}({\bf x}) = {\bf H}_4^{1213}({\bf x}) = \cdots
%% \end{eqnarray}
A graphical representation of $H_4$ in one and two dimensions is given in Fig.\ref{Fig1}. 
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{./fig1.eps}
  \end{center}

\label{Fig1}
\end{figure}

The inclusion of mode-coupling necessitates consideration of mixed
indices (nondiagonal tensor elements). Here, we focus on the coupling
between mode pairs and ignore threesome and higher order mixing, i.e.,
we consider only the bi-polynomials ${\bf H}^{i_1i_2\dots
i_\nu}_\nu(\Delta r_k,\Delta r_l)$ with $i_m \in \{k,l\}$,
$k,l=1,2,\dots,3N$. At first sight, estimating the contribution of
mode-coupling even at this lowest level appears to be a formidable
task, because the number of distinct expectation values to be
extracted from the data grows combinatorially. We show below that, the
factorization property of the off-diagonal tensor elements and the
orthogonality of the modes at the second order bring a significant
reduction in complexity, which we exploit to investigate the impact of
anharmonicity and mode-coupling separately on the protein dynamics.

We first observe that, the value of a tensor element ${\bf
H}^{i_1i_2\dots i_\nu}_\nu({\bf \Delta r})$ does not depend on the
order of the indices due to the commutativity of the gradient
operator, $\nabla_k\nabla_l - \nabla_l\nabla_k=0$. Therefore,
\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf H}^{i_1i_2\dots i_\nu}_\nu({\bf \Delta r}) &=& {\bf H}^p_\nu(\Delta r_k,\Delta r_l) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $p$ is the number of indices equal to $k$ (and the remaining
$\nu-p$ indices are equal to $l$). The fact that the covariance matrix
in the normal basis is diagonal further implies that
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{factorization}
{\bf H}^p_\nu({\bf \Delta r}) &=& H_p(\Delta r_1)\times H_{\nu-p}(\Delta r_2)
\end{eqnarray}
as is also evident from the Rodrigues's formula in Eq.~(\ref{Rodrigues}).

\subsection{Anharmonicity {\it vs} mode-coupling}

Combining Eq.~(\ref{coefs}) and Eq.~(\ref{factorization}), the Hermite
expansion in Eq.~(\ref{hermite_expansion}) can be cast into the
following form:
%% \begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{hermite_expansion2}
f({\bf\Delta r}) &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^N}} e^{ -\sum_i \Delta
  r_i^2/2} \bigg[ 1 + \sum_i\sum_{\nu=3}^\infty
  \frac{1}{\nu!}\, \Big\langle
  H_\nu(\Delta r_i)\Big\rangle\,H_\nu(\Delta r_i) \\
&+&  \sum_{i\ne j}\sum_{\nu=3}^\infty
  \frac{1}{\nu!}\,\sum_{p=1}^{\nu-1} {\nu\choose p} \Big\langle
  H_p(\Delta r_i)H_{\nu-p}(\Delta r_j)\Big\rangle\,H_p(\Delta r_i)H_{\nu-p}(\Delta r_j) + \sum_{i\ne j\ne k} \cdots \bigg] \nonumber
\label{eqn:8}
\end{eqnarray}
%% \end{widetext}
The first term in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:8}) corresponds to a purely harmonic model given by
the Gaussian probability distribution
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:f0}
f_0({\bf\Delta r}) &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^N}} e^{ -\sum_i \Delta
  r_i^2/2}\ .
\end{eqnarray}
This is the starting point for most of the past studies on protein
fluctuations~\cite{cui2006normal}. The next term in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:8}) is
appreciable when the fluctuations are anharmonic, but gives no information
about mode-coupling. In fact, the most general mode-amplitude
distribution of an anharmonic model composed of decoupled modes is
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:f1}
f_1({\bf\Delta r}) &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^N}}\ e^{ -\sum_i \Delta
  r_i^2/2} \times  \nonumber \\
&& \prod_i\bigg[ 1 + \sum_{\nu=3}^\infty
  \frac{1}{\nu!}\, \Big\langle
  H_\nu(\Delta r_i)\Big\rangle\,H_\nu(\Delta r_i)\bigg] 
\end{eqnarray}
The approximation to the true distribution given in
Eq.~(\ref{eqn:f1}) is named $f_1$ in order to remind the reader
that it qualitatively improves on the Gaussian approximation $f_0$
of Eq.~(\ref{eqn:f0}). The difference between the full pdf given in
Eq.~(\ref{hermite_expansion2}) and the approximation $f_1$ is the
mode-coupling corrections such as
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle H_p(\Delta r_i)H_{\nu-p}(\Delta r_j)\rangle - \langle
H_p(\Delta r_i)\rangle\langle H_{\nu-p}(\Delta r_j)\rangle &\neq& 0 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
and higher order cumulants. Note that, marginal distributions are transparent to
such corrections

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{marginal}
f(\Delta r_i) &\equiv& \int_0^\infty \prod_{j\ne i}d\Delta r_j\ f({\bf\Delta r})\ 
\end{eqnarray}
as a merit of the orthogonality relation in
Eq.~(\ref{eqn:orthogonality}). Therefore, even if the marginal
distributions are reproduced to good accuracy, the multidimensional
free-energy landscape of the protein may still be very different from
that implied by a model based on Eq.~(\ref{eqn:f1}). We demonstrate
below that this is the case for the protein Crambin. To this end,
we improve the approximation in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:f1}) one step
further and approximate $f({\bf\Delta r})$ by
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:f2}
f_2({\bf\Delta r}) &\equiv& f({\bf\Delta r}) - \sum_{i\ne j\ne k}\cdots
\end{eqnarray}
, i.e., the part of the Hermite expansion spelled out in
Eq.~(\ref{eqn:8}) which takes into account the mode-coupling
corrections at the lowest order they appear while ignoring cubic and
higher-order terms. The magnitude of the neglected terms can be
estimated through other means presented at the end of our paper.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Crambin molecular dynamics: a test ground}

Crambin (Protein Data bank code 1EJG.pdb) was selected as a test
ground since it is a relatively small protein and its dynamics is
widely
studied.~\cite{teeter1990harmonic,levitt1985protein,lange2006can} The
46 residue Crambin consists of 657 atoms. Taking only the alpha
carbons into account a set of 138 modes were obtained, six of which
have a zero eigenvalue corresponding to the translation of the center of mass 
and three global rotational degrees of freedom around it. 

All molecular
dynamics simulations were performed for an N,P,T ensemble in explicit
solvent (water) at 310 K using NAMD 2.5 package with CHARMM27 force
field. The protein was solvated in a waterbox of $15\,${\AA} cushion and
periodic boundary conditions were applied. Ions were added in order to
represent a more typical biological environment. Langevin dynamics was
used to control the system's temperature and pressure. All atoms were
coupled to the heat bath of temperature of 310 K. A time step of 1fs
was used. Nonbonded and electrostatic forces were evaluated at each time
step. In order to keep all degrees of freedom no rigid bonds were
used.  All structures were translated so that their centers of mass are
positioned at the origin and rotated to yield the best mass weighted
RMSD agreement with the initial structure \cite{yogurtcu2009statistical}.

\caption{A comparison of $f_0$ and $f_1$ and $f_2$ on the normalized
  histogram of the slowest mode. Note that $f_1$ and $f_2$ give the
  same marginal mode probabilities.}
\label{fig:f1histogram}
\end{figure}

The full dataset consists of 8967 snapshots of 132 modes taken at
$0.1$ ps intervals.  To prevent overfitting, every 9-th snapshot (a
total of 996) was reserved as the test set and the rest (7971
snapshots) were used as the training set.  Fig.~\ref{fig:timeplots}
gives the time plots of a few of the sample modes.  The average values
of the Hermite polynomials given in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:orthogonality}) are
calculated by averaging over 7971 snapshots of the fluctuation
trajectory. A maximum rank of 17 for the Hermite polynomial tensors
was observed to be sufficient for the convergence of our results.

\subsection{Entropy estimation}

In order to compare the quality of the three models $f_0$, $f_1$ and
$f_2$ (given respectively by Eqs.
~(\ref{eqn:f0},~\ref{eqn:f1}, and \ref{eqn:f2})), we use the average log
likelihood of the snapshots in the test data, given the parameters
optimized for the training data.  Eq.~(\ref{eqn:logl}) defines the average
log likelihood of the data.  ${\bf\Delta r}^{(i)}$ denotes the $i$-th
snapshot and ${\cal N}$ is the number of snapshots.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:logl}
\left< \log f({\bf\Delta r}) \right>
&=& \int f({\bf\Delta r}) \log f({\bf\Delta r}) d{\bf\Delta r} \nonumber \\
&\approx& \frac{1}{\cal N} \sum_{i=1}^{\cal N} \log f({\bf\Delta r}^{(i)})
\end{eqnarray}

From the definition of the log likelihood given in
Eq.~(\ref{eqn:logl}) it immediately follows that the entropy, $S$,
can be estimated as $S/k_B = -\left< \log f({\bf\Delta r}) \right>$ where
$k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.  
The average log likelihood based on
$f_0$ is -187.5 per snapshot, corresponding to 115.5 kcal/mol
contribution to the free energy.  The latter is obtained as $TS = -RT \left< \log f({\bf\Delta r}) \right>$, $R=1.986$ cal/mol, $T$ = 310 K.

Fig.~(\ref{fig:f1histogram}) compares the $f_0$ and $f_1$
distributions for the slowest mode, obtained from the test data. The
anharmonicity of the dynamics is clear and is well represented by
$f_1$.  The free energy equivalent of the $f_1$ entropy is 115.1
kcal/mol which is only 0.4\% less than that of $f_0$. 

\subsection{Mode-coupling corrections}

\begin{figure*}[ht!]\centering
   \includegraphics[width=.30\textwidth]{fig4a.eps}
   \includegraphics[width=.30\textwidth]{fig4b.eps}
   \includegraphics[width=.30\textwidth]{fig4c.eps}
\caption{A comparison of $f_1$, $f_2$ and KDE against a scatter plot of the
  two slowest modes.}
\label{fig:contour}
\end{figure*}

The $f_2$ approximation in Eq.~(\ref{hermite_expansion2}) introduces
pairwise interactions between modes. Note that, the correction due to
the mode-coupling terms included in $f_2$ is invisible at the level
of the marginal distibutions, such as in
Fig.~(\ref{fig:f1histogram}). Therefore we compare in the first two
panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:contour} the contour plots of $f_1$ and
$f_2$ distributions with the scatter plot of the two slowest 
modes. The free energy landscape of the protein is captured visibly
better by $f_2$ when compared to $f_1$. The contribution at the level
of $f_2$ to free energy equivalent of entropy is 110.9 kcal/mol. This
results in a correction of $\approx -4.6$ kcal/mol to the free energy
{\it solely due to mode-coupling.}

\subsection{Higher-order coupling}

To quantify the effects of phenomena beyond pairwise interactions, we
further used non-parametric kernel density estimation (KDE) procedure
to model the probability density of the training set.  In this
approach, one fits the data using second-order Gaussian kernels with
fixed bandwidths optimized by likelihood cross validation.  We used
the ``npudensbw'' and ``npudens'' procedures from the ``np'' package
for the ``R'' statistical computing environment~\cite{hayfield2008nonparametric}.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:contour}, the results of KDE are presented in the
third panel.  These results are representative of all orders of
contributions to anharmonicity and mode coupling and may be used to
obtain a reasonable upper bound on the impact of mode-coupling on
protein energetics.  The free energy equivalent of the entropy
calculated by the KDE is 108.4 kcal/mol.  This shows that the total
reduction in entropy due to anharmonicities and coupling relative to
Gaussian is 7.1 kcal/mol, or 6.1\% for Crambin.

\section{Conclusion}

The probability distributions of residue fluctutations obtained by the
Hermite series expansion and the KDE give consistent measures of the
fluctuational entropy of the protein Crambin in its native state. The
Gaussian approximation $f_0$ gives a value of $TS = 115.5 \mbox{
  kcal/mol}$.  Introduction of anharmonicities in the absence of mode
coupling reduces the entropy to $TS = 115.1 \mbox{ kcal/mol}$.
Inclusion of second order mode coupling further reduces the entropy to
$TS=110.9 \mbox{ kcal/mol}$.  The KDE, which takes all orders of
correlations and mode coupling into account yields an entropy of $TS =
108.4 \mbox{ kcal/mol}$.  In conclusion, we find that the effect of
anharmonicity and correlations on the entropy is about 6\% as
determined from the difference between the Gaussian and the KDE
approximations. The Hermite expansion of the configurational
p.d.f. suggests that the correlations (i.e., mode-coupling) account
for a large portion of this correction. In a strict sense, 6\% is a
lower bound on the best estimate one can obtain from the given data -
although, presumably not too far from it in view of the nonparametric
nature of the KDE method. Finally, in spite of their relatively small
weight, we see that both corrections to the Gaussian approximation
strongly modify the shape of the free-energy landscape of the protein
in the vicinity of its native state. Most of the contribution due to
anharmonicity is from the modes corresponding to the largest
eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (i.e., slowest modes), yet a
quantitive evaluation of the contribution to the fluctuation entropy
in terms of the eigenvalues appears to be a nontrivial task. It is
nevertheless worth stressing that, unlike in a harmonic system, the
different fluctuational modes contribute unequally to the free energy
of a native protein.

Anharmonicity of protein motions has been addressed in several earlier
papers by means of principal component analysis
\cite{hayward1994harmonic,maisuradze2007free,maisuradze2009adequate,altis2008construction}. Hayward{\it
  et al.}\cite{hayward1994harmonic} used a quasiharmonic approximation
to the anharmonic energy surface having multiple minima, where the
fluctuation distribution function was treated as a multivariable
Gaussian, with the variables being the normal modes of the molecular
dynamics trajectory. If hopping between different minima is
suppressed, then the quasiharmonic approximation reduces to normal
mode analysis. In the present paper, the quasiharmonic approximation
would obtain if the sum in the brackets in
Eq.~(\ref{hermite_expansion}) were set to zero, subject to the
conditions given by Eqs.~(\ref{eq:rotation}\&\ref{eqn:pair_corr}).

The higher-order moments in Eq.~(\ref{hermite_expansion}) include
terms necessary to go beyond the quasiharmonic
approximation. Maisuradze and Leitner~\cite{maisuradze2007free}
applied the principal component analysis to a tetrapeptide and
analyzed the free energy surface using only the largest two
eigenvectors obtained from the dihedral angle space. Their analysis
contains the coupling effects between the first two eigenvectors. In
the present work we also expressed the free energy surface keeping
mode pairs, but contrary to the the treatment of
Ref.\cite{maisuradze2007free} all pairs are
included. Ref.\cite{maisuradze2007free} also discussed the problems
with sampling convergence based on the first two mode analysis. In our
case …(Denizin dun anlattiklarina uyan birsey ekeleyebilir miyiz
buraya, veya Denizin argumanlarini buraya koyabiliriz. )

Maisuradze {\it et al.}~\cite{maisuradze2009adequate} investigated the
folding and unfolding of the B domain of staphylococcal protein by a
coarse-grained principal component analysis and showed that while a
one or two dimensional free energy landscape is sufficient for
describing folding and unfolding, it may fail in describing the
stability of the native state. Their work considers the
folding/unfolding of a protein, and therefore deviates from the
present work that focuses on fluctuations about the native
state. Nevertheless, their observations are relevant, and the need to
go to higher dimensions is pertinent. Similarly, Altis {\it et al.}
showed that a five dimensional landscape in dihedral space is
necessary to properly characterize the free energy
landscape~\cite{altis2008construction}.

The main difference of the present work from these past studies is
that, by means of a Hermite expansion we take into account all of the
principal components, in contrast with the restricted numbers
considered
in~\cite{maisuradze2007free,maisuradze2009adequate,altis2008construction}. The
constraint on the Hermite series expansion is twofold: maximum tensor
rank and the order of coupling. A cutoff on the maximum rank can be
made as large as computationally possible, since their evaluation is
straightforward. The order of coupling (two-body, three-body, etc) is
more subtle. In the present paper, we treated the first- and
second-order couplings only. Including the higher-order terms is a
computational challange. Instead, we supplemented our results by an
alternative nonparametric ``kernel density'' estimation method that in
effect considers all orders, but does not allow a separation of
elastic, anharmonic and mode-coupling contributions to the free
energy. Our results show that the difference between the Hermite
representation at the second-order and the KDE do not show marked
differences from each other.
