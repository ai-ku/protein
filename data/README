Protein feature data files contains both topological and energetic features including hermite analysis and residual energy contributions.

Feature name : Description
	- Nneighbour     : # of neighbour in 7$\AA$ distance
	- Sasa           : Solvent accesible surface area. Value is greater if residue is close to the surface
	- SasaNx         : Sasa score for the x^th closest neighbour.
	- Mx             : Mode displacement for x^th mode.
	- McIntersectx   : Intersect peak residues of x^th mode couple. "mc1 $\cap$ mc2"
	- McDiffSlowx    : Set differance of slow and fast modes of x^th mode couple
	- McDiffFastx    : Set differance of fast and slow modes of x^th mode couple
	- ConvSinglesx   : Amplitutes of convolution between x^th couple modes
	- ConvPeaksx     : Peak values of ConvSinglesx
	- Appearance     : First appeared couple of residue
	- Occurance      : Occurance of residues in all couples
	- Entropy_Diff	 : Differance of entropy for first appeared mode couple 
	- Peak_fast      : Amplitude of peaks in fast mode in first appeared couple
	- Peak_slow      : Amplitude of peaks in slow mode in first appeared couple
	- Residual_energy: Energy contribution of given residue for all dynamics
	- Conservation   : Evolutionary onservation scores. Large values are more valuable
	- ConservationNx : Conservation score of nearest x^th residue
	* Verified       : 1 for experimentally verified residues.
	* VerifiedCmapx  : Nearest neighbours for threshold=x labeled as verified
	* VerifiedChainx : Nearest neighbours on aminoacid chain neighbours for left and right x neighbour labeled as verified
